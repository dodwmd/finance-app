## Key Learnings

### Laravel 11/12
- Laravel 12.9.2 uses a different approach to asset bundling with Vite
- Tailwind CSS 4.x requires special configuration for PostCSS
- Modern Laravel apps benefit from leveraging Blade components for UI

### Docker & Development Environment
- Using Docker volumes ensures code changes are immediately available without rebuilds
- Environment-specific configurations help avoid port conflicts
- Health checks ensure database services are fully initialized before application starts

### GitHub & CI/CD
- Branch protection rules can be configured via GitHub CLI or API
- Status checks must match the exact format from GitHub Actions workflows
- Solo developers need different branch protection strategies than teams

### Code Quality Tools
- PHPStan requires special configuration to work with Laravel's dynamic features
- Laravel Pint provides standardized code style with minimal configuration
- Running code quality checks in CI ensures consistent standards

### Development Workflow
- Pull request workflow provides change tracking even for solo developers
- Automated tests in CI catch issues before they reach production
- Separating application into DDD layers improves testability and maintenance

### Recurring Transactions Implementation
- Laravel's IoC container requires proper interface bindings for dependency injection
- Direct model usage can help avoid dependency resolution issues during development
- Laravel scheduler provides a simple way to automate recurring tasks
- Using match expressions simplifies frequency-based date calculations
- Form interfaces benefit from JavaScript for dynamic content based on user selections

### Budget Planning Implementation
- Using repository pattern with interfaces allows for easier testing and maintenance
- Creating dedicated service methods for complex budget calculations improves separation of concerns
- Leveraging Laravel's query scopes simplifies common filtering operations
- Using Carbon for date manipulation simplifies period-based calculations
- Interactive budget progress visualization enhances user experience

### Testing Implementation
- Using flexible assertions for date comparisons is essential due to Carbon's precise time handling
- When testing with databases, understanding constraints is critical (e.g., enum values for category types)
- Mock data should accurately reflect database constraints to avoid constraint violation errors
- Testing calculation-heavy methods requires careful preparation of test data with predictable results
- Laravel's RefreshDatabase trait ensures a clean state for each test
- Date handling between strings and Carbon objects requires special attention in assertions

### Social Authentication Implementation
- Laravel Socialite provides a convenient way to integrate with OAuth providers
- Handling user data merging requires careful consideration of existing accounts
- Mocking external services is essential for reliable testing
- Proper error handling improves user experience when authentication fails
- Supporting multiple providers requires flexible user database schema

### API Implementation
- Laravel Sanctum provides a straightforward approach to token-based authentication
- Rate limiting is essential for protecting the API from abuse
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation improves developer experience
- Using JSON resources ensures consistent data formatting across endpoints
- Following RESTful principles promotes a maintainable API structure

## Current Issues & Blockers
- No critical blockers at this time

## Next Steps Priority
1. Add two-factor authentication
2. Configure production deployment pipeline
3. Enhance email verification flow
